# syzygy
A one-man project to learn the basics of game engines. No hardware acceleration, just software rendering.

This is what I'm currently want to learn:

- Active rendering
- BSP's, quadtrees, octrees
- Visibility culling
- 2D and (full) 3D
- Dynamic view frustum (= dynamic FOV)
- Different projections (e.g. perspective and orthogonal)
- Math, vectors, transformation matrices
- ...
